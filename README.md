# No Skill Drain

This does the exact same as if you would die twice within short period of time, where also no skill drain is active as a
buf. The difference is that this mod doesn't need the buff active, but will just adjust the skill lowering on death.

## Features

* Config synced (server sync)
* Optionally you can also change the config value that is set to -100 (%) per default.
* Values bigger -100 will act as a multiplier to the skill drain.
